SQL files for the World Life Expectancy portfolio project 

### Project Summary

**Objective:**  
This project aims to analyze global life expectancy data to identify trends, disparities, and influencing factors across different regions and populations.

**Methodology:**  
Using a comprehensive dataset sourced from reputable organizations such as the World Health Organization (WHO) and the World Bank, we will perform statistical analyses to examine life expectancy figures across various countries. The analysis will include:

1. **Descriptive Statistics:** Summary of average life expectancies, ranges, and distributions.
2. **Comparative Analysis:** Cross-country comparisons to highlight disparities based on geographic, economic, and social factors.
3. **Trend Analysis:** Examination of life expectancy changes over the past few decades to identify significant trends.
4. **Correlational Studies:** Investigation of the relationship between life expectancy and factors such as GDP, healthcare access, education levels, and lifestyle choices.

**Expected Outcomes:**  
The project aims to produce a detailed report that highlights key findings, including:

- Identification of regions with the highest and lowest life expectancies.
- Insights into factors contributing to longevity and disparities in life expectancy.
- Recommendations for policymakers to address inequalities and improve health outcomes.

**Implications:**  
The findings will inform public health initiatives and policy decisions aimed at enhancing life expectancy and quality of life globally, particularly in underserved regions. By understanding the underlying factors affecting life expectancy, stakeholders can better target interventions and resources.

**Target Audience:**  
The results will be valuable for public health officials, policymakers, researchers, and organizations focused on global health and development.
